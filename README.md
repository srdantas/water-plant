# Water Plant
The general objective of this project is to carry out an automated irrigation through the NodeMcu ESP8266 microcontroller, and to use an internet and the MQTT protocol to generate data and publish on a page on the [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com/).

## We recommand read [peper](paper.pdf)

### For this project, we using: 
 - [NodeMCU ESP8266](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266/overview)
 - DHT11
 - Sensor humidity FC-28
 - Water pump 5V 
 - RelÃª 5V two channels 
 - Protoboard
 - Voltage converter for protoboard
 - Source 12V
 - Jumpers
 - microUSB

### You need a arduino libs:
 - Library ESP
 - Library DHT.h
 - Library SPI.h
 - Library PubSubClient.h
